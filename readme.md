# Amazon Product Recommendation System using Spark and Python 

Online E-commerce websites like Amazon, Filpkart uses different recommendation models to provide different suggestions to different users. 
Amazon currently uses item-to-item collaborative filtering, which scales to massive data sets and produces high-quality recommendations in real time. 
This type of filtering matches each of the user's purchased and rated items to similar items, then combines those similar items into a recommendation list for the user. 
In this project we are going to build recommendation model for the different products of Amazon.

# Attribute Information:

● overall: Rating of the corresponding product by the corresponding user

● verified: Every user is either reviewed or not

● reviewTime: Time when review is provide

● reviewerID: Every user identified with a unique id

● asin: Every product identified with a unique id

● reviewerName: Name of the user

● timestamp: Time of the rating

# Objective:

Objective for this Project is to Recommend Products to the User based on their previous reviews to the various items. To achieve this goal we will be using K-Means and Naive Bayes algorthim. We will also compare the the result with ALS (Alternative Least Square)
method which is widely used method for Recommendation Systems.
